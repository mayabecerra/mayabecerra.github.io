## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, Part 2

    This was one of my favorite labs because it was one I understood even though I had barely begun coding. I liked the JulianDay equation because it was something I hadn't heard about till the lab. This was also a lab I could code on my own since the past two labs I had asked for help from my partners.

* Lab 7, Part 1

    Lab 7 was one of my favorites as well because this was one I had difficulty with so it took a while, but I think I got more satisfaction when I finished since I knew it was hard for me. I had trouble with if statements before this, but this lab made me understand them more since the .cc file had only if statements.

* Lab 12, Part 1

    This was my third favorite lab mostly because it was the last one and I thought it was a nice idea on creating a GIF. I found lab 12 the most difficult, which I think was the point, but I enjoyed it and it felt nice knowing I could actually code it.
